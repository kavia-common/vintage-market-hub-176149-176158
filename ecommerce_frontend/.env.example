# Frontend environment variables (copy this file to ".env" and fill in values)
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit your real .env file to version control.

# Base URL for the backend API the React app will call.
# In local development, if the backend runs on port 3001 (FastAPI), use:
# http://localhost:3001
# In deployment, set this to your backend public URL, e.g.:
# https://api.your-domain.com
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Publishable key for your payment provider (e.g., Stripe)
# This must be the PUBLIC (publishable) key only. NEVER store secret keys in the frontend.
# Example (Stripe): pk_test_12345... (dummy value below for structure)
REACT_APP_PAYMENT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here

# Notes:
# - Create React App exposes variables prefixed with REACT_APP_ at build time.
# - After updating this file (and your local .env), restart the dev server if it's already running.
